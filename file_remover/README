A Tool for deleting the files
Rather than just deleting the file, this tool overwrite the whole file with 0s and then deletes it.
With that there is another layer of security provided!

Usage:
cargo run <file_name_extension> // cargo run foo.txt
./target/release/rustrm <file_name_extension>

Or rather copy the binary to usr/local/bin file to run it from terminal and binary name "rustrm" without leading . by using the following command
sudo cp /target/release/rustrm <paste_the_path_to_/usr/local/bin>
